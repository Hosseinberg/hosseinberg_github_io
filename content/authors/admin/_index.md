I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Integrated Quantum Photonics at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca) & [Xanadu](xanadu.ai). My long-standing interest has always been in understanding the true nature of light, its properties, and its applications in both the classical and quantum domains. Hence, after graduating in Optics and Laser Engineering I pursued a master's degree in Photonics and started working on optical metamaterials. I continued my academic path by joining [Prof. Dignam's research group](https://www.physics.queensu.ca/~dignam/) at [Queen's University](https://queensu.ca) as a Ph.D. student in Physics working on the dynamics of classical and nonclassical states of light in integrated waveguide platforms. After graduation, I decided to join [Prof. Sipe's group](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~sipegroup/) as a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca) to collaborate with researchers at [Xanadu](xanadu.ai) on cutting-edge projects in the photonic-base quantum computing industry.
