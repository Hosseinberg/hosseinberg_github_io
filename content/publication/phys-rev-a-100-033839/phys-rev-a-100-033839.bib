 abstract = {We present an integrated source of counterpropagating entangled states based on a coupled resonator optical waveguide that is pumped by a classical pulsed source incident from above the waveguide. We investigate theoretically the generation and propagation of continuous-variable entangled states in this coupled-cavity system in the presence of intrinsic loss. Using a tight-binding approximation, we derive analytic time-dependent expressions for the number of photons in each cavity, as well as for the correlation variance between the photons in different pairs of cavities, to evaluate the degree of quantum entanglement. We also derive simple approximate expressions for these quantities that can be used to guide the design of such systems, and discuss how pumping configurations and physical properties of the system affect the photon statistics and the degree of quantum correlation.},
